# EDUCATION

> ###  2019 – Now **MS Computer Science, College of Information Science and Engineering, Chongqing Jiaotong University**

>> -   First year exam results: 86.5/100

>> -   Researched and delivered on time six 3,000 word essays on new topics in each
    eight week term for discussion with peers and leading academics

> ###  2014 – 2018 **BS Mechanical Engineering, College of Mechanical Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology**

# RESEARCH EXPEREINCE

> &ensp;&ensp; My research interests mainly focus on **<big> Machine Learning and Operational Research </big>** with strong self-motivation. I'm instrested in utilizing deep learning model to solve practical problems with high-precision. Also, I'd good at constructing mathematical optimization models by abstracting practical problems in real life, and then a optimal solution will be given by designing effective algorithms to solve the optimization models.
